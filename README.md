This is a simple webpage that uses Javascript to load a random quote. 
The user can press a button to get a new quote. 
If the quote goes approximately 20 seconds without the user pressing the button to change it, the quote will be changed automatically. The quote being changed automatically or the user pressing the button to change the quote will both reset the 20 sec timer. 
The quote will always have a source, and may also have a year, a citation, and zero or more categorization tags. 
Each time the quote changes, the background color is set to a new random color.
